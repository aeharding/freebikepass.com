      <h3>Step 1: Agreement </h3>

      <p>
        ðŸ¥± (I promise this is the most boring part.) In order to get a bike
        trail pass, you must acknowledge the following. And no, we don't know
        what "necessary" means. Only you know what's "necessary" for you to live
        your life.
      </p>

        This statement is submitted in support of an application for a commuter
        pass for the Capital City State Trail, subsidized by the Dane County
        Highway &amp; Transportation Department. The undersigned hereby
        certifies that he or she uses the Capital City State Trail primarily for
        transportation rather than recreational purposes, and will utilize a
        trail pass provided by Dane County primarily for Transportation
        purposes. (Transportation purposes means commuting to work, school,
        shopping or other necessary activities.) I will primarily use the
        Capital City State Trail for commuting between the following locations:
        <ul>
          <li>
            From: Home, To: Work, school, shopping or other necessary activities
          </li>
          <li>
            From: Work, school, shopping or other necessary activities To: Home
          </li>
          <li>
            From: Work, school, shopping or other necessary activities To: Work,
            school, shopping or other necessary activities
          </li>
        </ul>
